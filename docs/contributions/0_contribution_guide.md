# BetterVoting contribution guide

We're so excited you're interested in contributing! Here's how to get plugged in

1. [Join Equal Vote](https://equal.vote/join) : BetterVoting is a project of the Equal Vote Coalition, a nonpartisan 501c3 nonprofit. Joining will sign you up for email updates, add you to the slack, and bring you in contact with our volunteer coordinator. 

1. <b>Create a GitHub account</b> : All roles will require a GitHub account (even if you're not a developer). Once you've created an account [drop an email to arendpeter@equal.vote](mailto:arendpeter@equal.vote?subject=Triage%20Permissions%20Request&body=Hi%20there!%20Please%20add%20triage%20permissions%20for%20INSERT_GITHUB_USER_NAME.) with your account name so you can be setup with basic triage permissions. Then you can continue to the next steps, no need to wait for a response.

1. <b>Get setup for your role</b> :
