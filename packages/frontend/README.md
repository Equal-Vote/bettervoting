## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:


### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run clean`
Deletes the node_modules and build artifacts.
Note: this also removes the shared node_modules from the parent directory which will remove dependencies of sister packages and will require `npm i` for the workspace.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the preview mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

This allows you to see the built version of local code.
